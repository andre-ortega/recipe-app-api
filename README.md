# recipe-app-api

This project was completed in preparation for some freelance development work involving Django. It is a simple
recipe app that integrates test-driven development with cloud deployment on Travis-CI. A docker file was created
but not unused due to the limited scope of deployment.

Postgresql was the database of choice and allows user to be associated with their recipes using ingredients
that are already present in the database, or can be added. An image related to the recipe may also be uploaded.
Uses Django's default display templates and admin pages.
